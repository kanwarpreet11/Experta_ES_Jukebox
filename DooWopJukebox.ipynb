    "This DooWop Jukebox Expert System works as a Doo Wop artist recommender based on selection by user on various pre-define percepts, namely - Singer Type (Band or Individual), Tempo (Fast or Slow) and Gender (Male or Female).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ps. Doo Wop is a genre of music interchangably (because of an overlap) used with other genre including Rhythm and Blues, Rock and Roll, Rockabilly etc. This is a simple ES recommender that based on user choices recommends a suitable Doo Wop band/individual singer to listen too. Since the singers/bands recommended here might have songs both fast and slow, the developer has taken discretion to classify them based on personal choice or more generic style of these artists. This ES can be further developed to recommend random varied choices within each set of selections as well, for ex. for Individual, Fast and Male, the ES might recommend Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry etc randomly each time these selections are made. Further, using a feedback loop from user, recommender can be made to learn and provide recommendations based on a users preferences, which opens up scope for ML based AI."
